Training of neural networks for automated diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is hampered by the small size and lack of diversity of available dataset of dermatoscopic images. We tackle this problem by releasing the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset.

Classes:

1. Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec)
2. basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
3. benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, bkl)
4. dermatofibroma (df)
5. melanoma (mel), 
6. melanocytic nevi (nv)
7. vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc).
